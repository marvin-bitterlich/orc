  Defines the complete lifecycle of a Shipment entity in ORC.
  Shipments are work packages within a mission that contain related tasks.
  Unlike groves (infrastructure), shipments are workflow entities with pause/resume semantics.

# STATES

states:
  initial:
    description: No shipment exists yet (pre-creation)

# =============================================================================
# DIFFERENCES FROM GROVE
# =============================================================================
differences_from_grove:
  - |
    Shipments have 'paused' state; groves do not.
    Pausing a shipment halts work; groves are infrastructure.
  - |
    Shipments have 'complete' state; groves have 'archived'.
    Completion is a workflow state; archival is soft-delete.
  - |
    Shipments have 'pinned' flag; groves do not.
    Pinning prevents accidental completion of important work.
  - |
    Shipments do NOT have 'archived' state.
    Shipments are either active/paused/complete or deleted.
  - |
    Shipments do NOT have ORC-only guards.
    Any agent (ORC or IMP) can manage shipments.
  - |
    Shipments have grove assignment with exclusivity.
    Groves don't have this inverse relationship.

# =============================================================================
# NOTES
# =============================================================================
notes:
  - |
    Shipment is a workflow entity - it represents a package of work.
    Unlike Grove (infrastructure), shipments have pause/resume/complete semantics.
  - |
    The 'pinned' flag prevents accidental completion of important shipments.
    Users must explicitly unpin before completing.
  - |
    Grove assignment is exclusive - a grove can only be assigned to one shipment.
    This prevents work conflicts and maintains clear ownership.
  - |
    No ORC-only guards - shipments are managed by both ORC and IMPs.
    This differs from groves where only ORC can create/archive.
